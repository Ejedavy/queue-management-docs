## Purpose

The primary goal of QEase is to transform traditional queue management into a seamless and interactive digital experience. By leveraging advanced technologies, QEase enables organizations to optimize their service delivery, enhance operational efficiency, and improve client satisfaction. The platform facilitates a smoother flow of people through services, reduces overcrowding, and allows users to monitor and manage queues effectively.

## Technology Stack

QEase is built on FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. The key features of QEase include:

- **FastAPI Framework:** For creating RESTful API endpoints with automatic interactive API documentation.
- **Uvicorn:** An ASGI server for running the application, known for its high performance.
- **PostgreSQL:** The primary database, managed within Docker containers for development and production environments.
- **Alembic:** For database migrations, ensuring that database schema updates are version controlled and deployable.
- **Docker:** Used to containerize the application and its dependencies, facilitating consistent environments and easy deployment.

## About the Developer

QEase was developed by Eje David, a student at Innopolis University, as part of the coursework for Technical Communication. The project showcases the integration of technical expertise and communication skills to deliver a software solution that addresses real-world problems.
